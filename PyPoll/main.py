# * As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

#   ```text
#   Election Results
#   -------------------------
#   Total Votes: 3521001
#   -------------------------
#   Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
#   Correy: 20.000% (704200)
#   Li: 14.000% (492940)
#   O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
#   -------------------------
#   Winner: Khan
#   -------------------------
#   ```

# * In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
